&lt;p&gt;I just finished &lt;a href="https://press.stripe.com/working-in-public"&gt;Working in Public: The Making and Maintenance of Open Source
Software&lt;/a&gt; by Nadia Eghbal.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It was interesting to read about a world I&amp;rsquo;ve been a part of and to have some concepts defined and
discussed. My big takeaways are that software has this historical burden to it because people didn&amp;rsquo;t
know how to make money off of it. It looks like writing, but is only words on a dead tree with no
value until you try to use it. And once you try to use it, it&amp;rsquo;s alive and needs to maintained like
an aging dog. Software is also not like a commodity that loses value once more people use it.
Software can be ideas, and ideas want to spread and be free (as in beer) and should be free (as in
freedom).&lt;/p&gt;</description></item></channel></rss>
