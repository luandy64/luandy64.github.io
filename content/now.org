* Self Hosting stuff

I'm working on my tech independence and putting my tech skills to the test.

This also relates to things I've been reading about permacomputing. By keeping the services I depend
on to things that I can host and maintain and on older hardware that I'm in charge of, maybe I'm
taking a step towards making technology more sustainable for the planet.

* Go

In my spare time, I've been learning how to play [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Go_(game)][Go]].

* BJJ

I got my purple belt from Balance Studios on 2023-10-28.
