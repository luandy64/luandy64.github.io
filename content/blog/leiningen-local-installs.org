You can quickly create a new library with =lein new default my-library-name=.

But if you add a =group-id= to that, =lein= is smart enought to just use the =artifact-id= for the
directory name, but the full maven id when installing to your local repository.

I thought I was having issues with using =my-library-name= vs. =dev.andylu/my-library-name=, but I
can't reproduce the weird behavior now.

So I'm going to chalk it up to the usual "I don't own the =~/.m2= folder" and just run =sudo chown
-R "$USER":"$USER" ~/.m2= and forget about it.
