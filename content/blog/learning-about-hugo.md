- I think I've tried to keep a blog going for so long and on so many different stacks that I never
sat down to learn about how `hugo` works.

- Like wow, I can write some templating, shove it in a "shortcode", and reuse it everywhere?

- Testing it now: [Docs](https://minimo.netlify.app/docs/shortcodes/)

- Here's a center block

{{< center >}}

I'm not entirely sure when I would be using this center thing. It feels like one of those "pull a
quote out of the larger article things". ~~I kind of wish it had a border of some kind or a background
difference~~ Just kidding, I easily updated the shortcode with what I wanted

{{< /center >}}


{{< center >}}

Here is some centered text

It's a ton of words

hi

{{< /center >}}


- End of center block
- I would try the conversation one, but I think it would look cooler as a text message bubble with
the left and right justification.
