* Monica

I like the thought of building this little database of info. But it does sound like a lot of work to
actually enter this information. I'm waiting for the next version of the app to release because
right now the self-hosted app hosts one account.

* Stalwart

I tried setting this up already, but hit some snags getting outbound SMTP working on Oracle Cloud.
It's weird because I was able to manually use =telnet= to get to an external relay service, but
=stalwart= could not do the same thing. I will pick this up again another day.
