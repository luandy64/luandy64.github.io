I have this line in my =bashrc=

#+begin_src bash
  # Prepend history entries with timestamps
  export HISTTIMEFORMAT='%FT%T%z '
#+end_src

I just learned that =~/.bash_history= does not have these timestamps, and neither does the menu presented to you in =fzf=.

But you do see it if you look in the output of the =history= command.
