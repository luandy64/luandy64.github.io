    <p>I&rsquo;ve made a couple attempts at this so far.</p>

<p>I didn&rsquo;t really give Cyrus a good go because I got Stalwart in a spot where I could receive messages
through IMAP.</p>
<p>I didn&rsquo;t get far at all with sending messages. Oracle is my currently cloud provider and port 25 is
blocked on my account.</p>
<p>The feature that drew me to both of these projects is JMAP support. I heard about it while talking
to a few people at a recent Philly JS meetup.</p>
<p>I think right now, the novelty of a new protocol is what makes me want to set up an email server.
The other reason I want to host it myself is to be able to host email for friends and family -
though no one has approached me about wanting a service like this.</p>
<p>The only scary part for me right now is that I don&rsquo;t know what it would take to provide a stable
service. But maybe that&rsquo;s not something I really need to think about. If my email goes down, I
probably have other things I need to be worried about.</p>
<p>Anyway, I&rsquo;ll see how much more time I want to throw at this. I think the most reasonable next step
is pay for Fastmail and watch Stalwart develop over the next year and maybe self host in the future.</p>
