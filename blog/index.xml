      <description>The first time I learned about git submodules was actually from working with hugo.
The documentation used to describe how you can have your main branch live in a directory that points to a diffent origin than your current branch.
It&amp;rsquo;s a cool feature that I never remember how to use, so here are notes I took after rediscovering it recently.
To add a submodule
git submodule add https://github.com/some-other-repo To clone a submodule locally</description>

      <description>Was in a flower shop today and the cashier was trying to describe how a big carton of silica gel can be used to dry out flowers.
I chuckled because I&amp;rsquo;m not entirely sure where to get a bunch of silica gel, but then thought it&amp;rsquo;s time to start hoarding &amp;ldquo;Do not eat&amp;rdquo; packets.</description>

      <description>Setup Installing docker I always like the DigitalOcean tutorials, so that&amp;rsquo;s what I followed here. Installing Docker on Ubuntu 20.04
One note: I had to restart my computer instead of just logging out in order to get the docker group update to take effect.
Clone the repos git clone git@github.com:KAllan357/answering-machine.git git clone git@github.com:KAllan357/telephone.git Nothing special here.
Install Go I just followed these instructions.
Do the thing Start the answering machine outside of docker Running go run main.</description>

      <description>Outcomes By the end of this post, you will be able to setup a new clojurescript project, setup emacs to be your development environment, and deploy your app to Github Pages
Background I&amp;rsquo;ve written two clojurescript projects now, Sundial and DataBooze, and I want to document the set up process. The first time was a massive undertaking because it was my first time. But frustrating enough, so was the second time, even though I thought I nailed down the process and took notes on it.</description>
