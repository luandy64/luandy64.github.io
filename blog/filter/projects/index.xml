      <description>These days I&amp;rsquo;ve been writing a lot of babashka instead of reaching for bash or python to do minor scripting tasks at work.&#xA;I am also a big fan of the work done at charm and the relevant products in this case are gum and lipgloss.&#xA;Using gum style I can log any text in basically any color I want. And while there&amp;rsquo;s not a ton of functional benefits to this, I think there&amp;rsquo;s something to be said about adding color into the logs we write.</description>

      <description>Outcomes By the end of this post, you will be able to setup a new clojurescript project, setup emacs to be your development environment, and deploy your app to Github Pages&#xA;Background I&amp;rsquo;ve written two clojurescript projects now, Sundial and DataBooze, and I want to document the set up process. The first time was a massive undertaking because it was my first time. But frustrating enough, so was the second time, even though I thought I nailed down the process and took notes on it.</description>
