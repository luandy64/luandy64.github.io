  <h1>Hello 2019</h1>
  <time datetime=2019-01-13T16:27:01-0500 class="post-date">Sun, Jan 13, 2019</time>
  <p>This post is really just a bookend for this blog.</p>

<p>2018 marked the end of my academic career and the start of my journey as a
software engineer.</p>

<h2 id="some-intentions-for-this-year">Some intentions for this year</h2>

<h3 id="writing-more">Writing more</h3>

<p>Last night while I was figuring out how to blog again, I was pleased to find
that I really do enjoy maintianing this site. This is perfect because I plan to
use it more to capture things I learn on a weekly basis. Really, I just plan to
use it more in general.</p>

<p>The schedule and format of it all is still up in the air right now. That might
come back to bite me in the butt as far as accountability goes, but we can deal
with that problem if/when it gets here.</p>

<h3 id="reading-more">Reading more</h3>

<p>Thanks to a nice perk at work, I have grown my library of technical books a bit.
Ideally I would be able to read them all this year. That doesn&rsquo;t seem like a
very attainable goal however, so I&rsquo;m starting small.</p>

<p>Here&rsquo;s the list:</p>

<ul>
<li><em>Design It! From Programmer to Software Architect</em> by Michael Keeling</li>
<li><em>The Go Programming Language</em> by Alan A. A. Donovan and Brian W. Kernighan</li>
<li><em>Getting Clojure</em> by Russ Olsen</li>
<li><em>Fluent Python</em> by Luciano Ramalho</li>
<li><em>The Rust Programming Language</em> by Steve Klabnik and Carol Nichols</li>
</ul>

<p>While these are the ones I&rsquo;m actively trying to read this year, I&rsquo;m sure others
will sneak in or some of these may be dropped.</p>

<h3 id="the-whys">The Whys</h3>

<p>As I&rsquo;ve learned while working on projects at work, documenting the reasoning
behind a decision is more important than documenting how something is done.</p>

<h4 id="the-writing">The writing</h4>

<p>The past has shown that I&rsquo;m pretty bad about sticking to a writing schedule.
While this is just another attempt at finding something that works for me, I am
also interested in capturing my professional growth over time. There&rsquo;s so much
that I&rsquo;m learning at work and it&rsquo;s hard to keep track of it all. A trick I
picked up in undergrad though, is to reflect on the new piece of knowledge you
just acquired and that helps it to stick in your memory. Just a few sentences
about it documenting questions or comments and hopefully in a year, I can see
the evolution of my understanding of a variety of topics.</p>

<h4 id="the-reading">The reading</h4>

<p><em>Design It!</em> calls itself a good introduction for people new to software
architecture. Being a topic I have very little familiarity with, that&rsquo;s a good
enough reason for me to just pick up a book and see what it&rsquo;s about. In general,
I&rsquo;m not a fan of doing things without a little background knowledge first. So
when I read the book&rsquo;s introduction, I was convinced this book would at least
give me the vocabulary to communicate effectively at work.</p>

<p><em>Fluent Python</em> is aimed at people wanting to be proficient at Python 3. It&rsquo;s a
giant book, but I&rsquo;ve learned quite a bit from it already so I&rsquo;m excited to
continue chipping away at it this year. I&rsquo;m hoping this book is the first step
in my journey to becoming a Python guru. It&rsquo;s a really cool language, but it&rsquo;s
tainted by people dragging over their habits from other languages.</p>

<p><em>Getting Clojure</em> intrigues me because of a stellar review from a coworker. I&rsquo;m
roughly half way through the book already and I&rsquo;m a fan of the author&rsquo;s writing
style. One of my favorite lines is in the intro: &ldquo;This book is for people with
some programming experience&hellip; who want to learn Clojure. Notice I didn&rsquo;t say
*learn to program in Clojure***. This book really feels like a conversation with
Olsen as opposed to a dry introduction to functional programming ideas and
Clojure syntax. The most important reason I picked up this book is because
Python and Clojure are the two main languages at work. So I want to at least be
familiar with Clojure sooner rather than later.</p>

<p><em>Go</em> has intrigued me for a while now. There&rsquo;s a story that I vaguely remember
hearing when I first heard about its existance; something like a group of (well
known) engineers at Google threw together a language because they were
unsatisfied with the ones they were using. Plus they had some downtime while a
project was compling, so a faster language was needed. I have no clue if any
part of that is true, but it&rsquo;s cool enough that I want to learn more about Go.
On top of that, since I&rsquo;m using Hugo to generate this site, I thought it would
be neat to learn a bit about what happens under the hood. I was actually reading
the first chapter yesterday and it&rsquo;s been a pretty good read so far.</p>

<p><em>Rust</em> is very much related to <code>C++</code> in my head, which I&rsquo;ve been feeling out of
touch with lately. It&rsquo;s hard for me to think outside of Python and I really want
(and should and need) to change that. So to see more of how languages do things
differently and to get back in touch with working with a lower-level, compiled
language, I picked up this book (and the <em>Go</em> book).</p>
