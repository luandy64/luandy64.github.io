  <h1>Personal Finance</h1>
  <time datetime=2018-09-19T00:35:01-0400 class="post-date">Wed, Sep 19, 2018</time>
  <p>I was determined to put something out tonight, so I just wanted to make a quick
note of today.</p>

<p>I delved into the world of personal finance and played around with a few
versions of a budget. To assist myself in making the budget, I wrote a little
Python script to juggle all of the variables I could think of. These all
interacted in a way that I think resembles how the world actually works- as far
as taxes and savings and whatnot goes.</p>

<p>The bulk of the advice I&rsquo;m following comes from Ramit Sethi, whose book, &ldquo;I Will
Teach You To Be Rich&rdquo;, I was able to check out from the library.</p>

<p>My main draw to Sethi is due to this one line I heard him say. It was along the
lines of, &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t think telling people to cut out their latte habit is sound
financial advice&rdquo;. Running the numbers, I agree with Sethi that it doesn&rsquo;t offer
a huge return on your effort and just ruins your morning if you love having a
latte to start the day.</p>

<p>So finance was today&rsquo;s focus. Maybe tomorrow will be another Clojure day so I
can slow down and really think through a financial plan.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;ll leave you with the main question I grappled with today: &ldquo;How much money do
you need, per month, to comfortably live after savings and expenses are
accounted for?&ldquo;.</p>
