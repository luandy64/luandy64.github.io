  <h1>Hugo Brainstorming</h1>
  <time datetime=2018-09-06T18:00:00-0500 class="post-date">Thu, Sep 6, 2018</time>
  <p>Today was a lot of interview prep. That&rsquo;s great because I like the
self-reflection time, but it doesn&rsquo;t leave too much time to work on these side
projects.</p>

<p>In the spirit of documenting my process of thinking and working, I want to talk
about how I&rsquo;m going to tackle the next step of this Hugo migration.</p>

<p>The problems I&rsquo;m facing, in no particular order, are:</p>

<ul>
<li>I need to change the front matter from how it is to something more consistent
for Hugo. Not all of my posts are consistent, but I can easily make it so</li>
<li>One pet peeve of of mine is the way images are handled in Markdown.

<ul>
<li>For one, it jacks up my file format/layout because sometimes the image is
inserted at the end of a line and I haven&rsquo;t explored how to wrap the line to
my desired 80 characters. Perhaps it really isn&rsquo;t a problem and I just need
to read some documentation. But it&rsquo;s on my mind</li>
<li>The way I would like to handle it is to reference some variable name in my
Markdown, which is then processed later to be replaced by the properly
formated <code>&lt;img&gt;</code> tag and whatnot. Each blog post already stores some
metadata about itself; moreover, it&rsquo;s in a <code>key:value</code> sort of thing with
<code>YAML</code>, so how hard can it be to say &ldquo;If you see this <code>key</code> in the Markdown,
then swap it with the <code>&lt;img&gt;</code> where the source is the <code>value</code>&rdquo;. I did a tiny
bit of research and it sounds like this feature is possible with something
called <code>shortcodes</code>. I&rsquo;ll look into and you&rsquo;ll find me writing about it in a
few days, I&rsquo;m sure</li>
</ul></li>
<li>I need to figure out how to restructure my posts to match the &ldquo;Hugo way&rdquo;. I
know that Jekyll was very very very flexible with whatever I threw at it. And
I&rsquo;ve read that Hugo is pickier. So I need to make this transition work and
work properly so that I&rsquo;m not fiddling with this down the road

<ul>
<li>Disclaimer: It&rsquo;s not that I don&rsquo;t like fiddling with this site. It&rsquo;s
literally one of the main reasons it exists. Heck, my love of tinkering is
what drives this migration in the first place. I have enough experience
with these static site generators that I&rsquo;d like to make sure I do things
right from now on. I&rsquo;m done with the &ldquo;I&rsquo;m learning and let&rsquo;s just get this
functional&rdquo;.
<br /></li>
</ul></li>
</ul>

<p>So to fix that front matter issue, I&rsquo;m definitely writing a script to do it. I
have just enough blog posts to say, no way I&rsquo;m not doing this by hand. I&rsquo;ve
thought about 7 steps that the script should take:
* Read in the current front matter
* Compare it to my &ldquo;ideal list&rdquo; of key-value pairs and keep the good ones
* Add the missing ones with default values I need to go in and change
* Add the filename to some list that tells me to look at some thing
* Also note which files have an image in them
* Make a new file containing the new front matter and the old content
* Put this new file in some target directory</p>

<p>The code will definitely look like: for every file in my <code>/posts</code> folder, do the
thing.</p>
