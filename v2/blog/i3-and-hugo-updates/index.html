  <h2 id="hugo-updates">Hugo Updates</h2>

<p>I spent a nice chunk of today figuring out what I wanted to do as far as styling goes. The theme I picked, <code>Hyde</code>, was did a
majority of the work already.</p>

<p>I just had to hook into the snippet of HTML that defines the <code>&lt;head&gt;</code> and add my own stylesheet. From there, the only change I
wanted to make was making everything a card. But then that led to some padding issues, so I patched that really quickly.</p>

<p>Overall, I&rsquo;m really satisfied with the design. Now I just have to move over all of the pages and blog posts. I learned that I
was pretty inconsistent with the front matter I included in the blog posts. I&rsquo;ll just have to go back and clean things up. I
will probably automate the adding and removing of the keys, but will have to add the values afterwards.</p>

<h2 id="i3-updates">i3 Updates</h2>

<p>I&rsquo;ve been gluing together bits and pieces of various configurations to get i3 to work. Some parts were quick:
* The background was straight forward
* Setting up my workspaces was easy
  - Though, I haven&rsquo;t bound certain applications to my named workspaces yet
* Installing Font Awesome was much easier than Source Code Pro. I might have to find an alternative here. It&rsquo;s mainly for<br />
  Spacemacs, but it seems to function fine without it.
* I&rsquo;ve themed i3 to match the Nord Theme for Spacemacs</p>

<p>The only- what I would call- dire issue is I can&rsquo;t get the brightness control to work. So as I sit here and type this, there&rsquo;s this blindingly bright screen that I&rsquo;m forced to look at and can do nothing about.</p>

<h2 id="next-steps">Next Steps</h2>

<p>I put some config stuff from my Mac onto Github, but I later learned, I didn&rsquo;t put some of the files I needed. I&rsquo;m hoping to
finish up with all of this i3 stuff soon and I can throw all of those files up too. I think a really nice guide is due too
because I wouldn&rsquo;t want someone else to try and do the same thing here and be as lost as I was.</p>
