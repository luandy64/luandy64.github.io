  <h2 id="little-bit-one-not-knowing-what-to-write-about">Little Bit One: Not knowing what to write about</h2>

<p>I woke up this morning not knowing what I want to talk about today. The other
days this week, I had a plan of attack for things I wanted to address.</p>

<p>Reading some articles about blogging though, it seems that some people advoate
for not posting something every day. I hear the appeals to health and
well-being; I get that it can be stressful to try and come up with something to
say every day.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m in a different camp though. Being someone who likes to juggle a lot of
projects at once, there&rsquo;s always an issue I could be working on. Maybe not even
an issue. During the &ldquo;complete-this-project&rdquo; phase, it&rsquo;s always nice to know
what the next step is; thus, having an unfinished project means there&rsquo;s always a
&ldquo;next thing&rdquo; to tackle.</p>

<p>Since I&rsquo;m not a super genius, working on a project means confronting a problem
and having to do a bit of digging to try and overcome it.</p>

<p>That&rsquo;s what I&rsquo;d like my blog posts to be about.</p>

<h2 id="little-bit-two-spacemacs-update">Little Bit Two: Spacemacs Update</h2>

<p>I took a step back from learning Spacemacs a while ago. It was eating up a lot
of time because I would have a question and google some things and get lost in
how great some other feature is. Time was not something I had a lot of because I
really wanted to finish  some websites and get the freeCodeCamp Responsive Web
Design certificate.</p>

<p>I still don&rsquo;t have the certificate; I am closer than I was when I stopped using
Spacemacs. I happened to open it up the other day and taking some notes with it
just felt great.</p>

<p>I found some new features that I can&rsquo;t see myself living without now:
* <code>SPC t r</code> toggles &ldquo;relative line numbers&rdquo; to appear. Instead of normal line
  numbers, I see how far away a line is from the line I am editing on. This is
  great to use with Vim navigation because I just type in the number of lines I
  want to move, the direction I want to go, and I go!
* <code>SPC t -</code> followed by <code>H</code> or <code>L</code> has changed the way I scroll through a
  document. The first command forces my cursor to sit on the equator of the
  screen. <code>H</code> says to move the cursor to the line at the top of my screen. So
  basically the whole screen scrolls until the top line is my equator line! <code>L</code>
  is the same thing, but for the bottom line.</p>

<p>The issue isn&rsquo;t that other editors can&rsquo;t do these things. It&rsquo;s 2018, I&rsquo;m sure
  someone somewhere has written the package that makes X editor do the same
  thing. It&rsquo;s just that I&rsquo;ll use Spacemacs for like an hour, get used to having
  the features, go use something else, realize I lack those features, and that&rsquo;s
  where the problem is: why take the time to install/configure the features,
  when I can just open Spacemacs and have it immdiately.</p>

<p>I like to refer to this <a href="https://xkcd.com/1205/">xkcd comic</a> when dealing with
  things like this.</p>

<h2 id="little-bit-three-coming-soon">Little Bit Three: Coming Soon</h2>

<p>I ended up having a lot to say here, so I&rsquo;m moving it to a new post. This one
turned out much longer than I thought it would.</p>
