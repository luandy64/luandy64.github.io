  <h1>My Studio Commandments</h1>

  <p>Inspired by <a href="https://superyesmore.com/studio-commandments-a5300cdf50b8a30ec909955b119f9174">this
post</a>
I read by Sarah Drasner, I thought it would be a really good idea to list my
&ldquo;studio commandments&rdquo;. Just like Sarah, I can see how these would change over
time. So while this is not what I would&rsquo;ve asked of myself in college, I think
these rules fit my work style these days.</p>

<p>I also like that this serves as a great snapshot of how my work style changes
with time. I am curious to see which rules persist or which rules get heavily
modified.</p>

<p>Without further ado,</p>

<h3 id="my-rules">My Rules</h3>

<ol>
<li><p>Start each day with a cup of coffee</p>

<ul>
<li>Okay, I lied, this one speaks to younger me too. I&rsquo;m sure this one is also
not going anywhere any time soon</li>
</ul></li>

<li><p>Keep water in arms reach, refill when empty</p>

<ul>
<li>This is a dual purpose rule. One is to counter any diuretic effects of
caffeine</li>
<li>Two is to make sure I get up every now and tehn to walk. I typically go
through 24 oz. (~710 mL for you metric folks) per 3 hours
<br /></li>
</ul></li>

<li><p>Race yourself: Set a crazy sounding time to finish a chunck of work/task and
try to achieve it</p>

<ul>
<li>I think this helps in trying to push me to work smarter. Best case
scenario I do what I set out to do; worst case scenario I spend a little more
time on the task and get it done anyway
<br /></li>
</ul></li>

<li><p>Getting distracted is okay, just don&rsquo;t get too distracted</p>

<ul>
<li>I know it&rsquo;s inevitable, but once I notice that I am distracted (obviously
easier said than done), I can start making decisions to get back to work
<br /></li>
</ul></li>

<li><p>Make notes of the process/steps of whatever task you do. For yourself and for
others in the same boat as you</p>

<ul>
<li>I know how it feels to reach some complicated documentation and feel
discouraged that it is a pain to read and try an comprehend. So this one
stems a bit from the boyscout rule: I want to leave the internet a little
better than when I found it
<br /></li>
</ul></li>
</ol>

<p>I will take some time to read over these before I work, just to make sure it
really sticks. I am curious to see what is wishful thinking or what is a rule I
choose to live by.</p>

<p>This all seems like I need to follow up with a post about work life balance
means to me. Maybe tomorrow&rsquo;s post can be about that!</p>
