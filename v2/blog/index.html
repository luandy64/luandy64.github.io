    <p>While working on a practice problem today, I realized I have to loop over a set
of things. Acutally, to get super specific I wanted to use two loops, one nested
in the other to do some comparisons between elements in the set.</p>

<p>I don&rsquo;t understand using a loop over a function call though.</p>

    <p>I&rsquo;ve been absorbing quite a bit of content from Gary Vaynerchuk lately. I really
like his idea of not making excuses and getting to work and eating dirt and
loving the process. I mean, it&rsquo;s hard to argue against those things and risk
being associated with negative things; despite that, I personally don&rsquo;t deny
they are good ideas. How much weight you give them is up to you.</p>

    I was determined to put something out tonight, so I just wanted to make a quick note of today.
I delved into the world of personal finance and played around with a few versions of a budget. To assist myself in making the budget, I wrote a little Python script to juggle all of the variables I could think of. These all interacted in a way that I think resembles how the world actually works- as far as taxes and savings and whatnot goes.

    Today I started reading through this book to learn some Clojure. It&rsquo;s called Clojure for the Brave and True.
I thought I would make myself a little cheatsheet that grows as I progress through the book.

    <p>Inspired by some posts I read on Medium, I found new reasons to build the habit
of keeping a journal. This whole idea deserves it&rsquo;s own post one day, but for
now I was just bringing it up because my journal is oriented by months.</p>

<p>For the month of September, I set out to blog more. More specifically, I devised
a schedule for myself and tried to stick to it.</p>

<p>While it was a bit confusing at first, the <a href="https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/HiDPI#Side_display">article on ArchWiki about

There wasn&rsquo;t a command on the page that was exactly what I needed, but between

I read by Sarah Drasner, I thought it would be a really good idea to list my

    <p>Do you like <code>bash</code> scripts? Personally, I don&rsquo;t.</p>

<p>So when I need to write bash scripts, I figure out the commands I need, then
glue them together with Python.</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s been a while since I&rsquo;ve needed to do this and while I neglected it before,
the <code>subprocess</code> module is the best way to run these commands.</p>

<p>Reading some articles about blogging though, it seems that some people advoate
for not posting something every day. I hear the appeals to health and
well-being; I get that it can be stressful to try and come up with something to
say every day.</p>

<p>So far, React has been fairly easy to pick up. It started with introducing this
idea of a <code>JSX Element</code>, which is a mix of HTML and JavaScript that wouldn&rsquo;t
work as pure HTML or pure JavaScript. There are these ideas of nesting the JSX
elements and <code>state</code>.</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s pretty common to see craftpeople creating tools for themselves for a
variety of reasons. Maybe it&rsquo;s because the exact tool they need doesn&rsquo;t exist;
perhaps a slight modification to a tool would help fit their style more.</p>

    <p>I just came across the so called &ldquo;Three Glass Problem&rdquo; and thought I would try
and solve it. It turns out to be fairly trivial with a bit of abstract algebra!</p>

    Opening a kiln never gets old. Especially a wood kiln when you never know what will happen to your pieces. Exhibit A is the figure on the far right of the picture. It was standing just fine going into the kiln, but for what is likely a combination of a lot of different reasons, a leg fell off. It&rsquo;s nothing a little super glue can&rsquo;t fix, so there are no negative feelings there.

    <p>Today was my first time in a long time trying to extract a bunch of information
from a website. I was trying to get a file from a set of webpages, so my first
thought was,</p>
    
    <div class="read-more-link">
        <a href="/v2/blog/python-web-scraping/">Read More…</a>
    </div>

    <h2 id="commands-needed">Commands Needed</h2>

<p>The easiest step was from the <a href="https://jekyllrb.com/docs/extras/">Jekyll Docs</a>,
which pointed me to this page on <a href="http://www.gastonsanchez.com/visually-enforced/opinion/2014/02/16/Mathjax-with-jekyll/">Visually
Enforced</a>.
So the following piece of code went into my <code>/_layouts/default.html</code> &rsquo;s header:</p>
    
    <div class="read-more-link">
        <a href="/v2/blog/added-mathjax-support/">Read More…</a>

    <p>The title says it all!</p>

<p>I finally got this site up and running. I could not have done it without a lot
of googling and stumbling upon Jekyll.</p>
