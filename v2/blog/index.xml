&lt;p&gt;I have to thank &lt;em&gt;Fluent Python&lt;/em&gt; for all of these tips and trick with Python.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You can implement dunder methods to make an object feel more Pythonic.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;This post is really just a bookend for this blog.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;2018 marked the end of my academic career and the start of my journey as a

      <description>&lt;p&gt;While working on a practice problem today, I realized I have to loop over a set
of things. Acutally, to get super specific I wanted to use two loops, one nested
in the other to do some comparisons between elements in the set.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I don&amp;rsquo;t understand using a loop over a function call though.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;ve been absorbing quite a bit of content from Gary Vaynerchuk lately. I really
like his idea of not making excuses and getting to work and eating dirt and
loving the process. I mean, it&amp;rsquo;s hard to argue against those things and risk
being associated with negative things; despite that, I personally don&amp;rsquo;t deny
they are good ideas. How much weight you give them is up to you.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>I was determined to put something out tonight, so I just wanted to make a quick note of today.
I delved into the world of personal finance and played around with a few versions of a budget. To assist myself in making the budget, I wrote a little Python script to juggle all of the variables I could think of. These all interacted in a way that I think resembles how the world actually works- as far as taxes and savings and whatnot goes.</description>

      <description>Today I started reading through this book to learn some Clojure. It&amp;rsquo;s called Clojure for the Brave and True.
I thought I would make myself a little cheatsheet that grows as I progress through the book.
Forms These are like the building blocks of the files.

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Inspired by some posts I read on Medium, I found new reasons to build the habit
of keeping a journal. This whole idea deserves it&amp;rsquo;s own post one day, but for
now I was just bringing it up because my journal is oriented by months.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For the month of September, I set out to blog more. More specifically, I devised
a schedule for myself and tried to stick to it.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;After a few hours of work, I was able to get the bare minimum of this site
rewritten for &lt;code&gt;hugo&lt;/code&gt;. I&amp;rsquo;ll work on finalizing the &lt;code&gt;/home&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;/about&lt;/code&gt; pages
slowly but surely; for now though, I am more than satisfied with just having the
blog up and running.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;I was working with Lauren to teach her how to convert between binary and decimal
numbers. I think it&amp;rsquo;s super interesting to get to visit these ideas with her and
see how &amp;ldquo;fresh eyes&amp;rdquo; see them for the first time.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Today was a lot of fiddling with &lt;code&gt;xrandr&lt;/code&gt; in order to get my laptop screen and
external monitor to play nice together.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While it was a bit confusing at first, the &lt;a href=&#34;https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/HiDPI#Side_display&#34;&gt;article on ArchWiki about
HiDPI&lt;/a&gt; was very useful.
There wasn&amp;rsquo;t a command on the page that was exactly what I needed, but between
the wiki and the man pages, I was able to piece together what I needed.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Today was a lot of interview prep. That&amp;rsquo;s great because I like the
self-reflection time, but it doesn&amp;rsquo;t leave too much time to work on these side
projects.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the spirit of documenting my process of thinking and working, I want to talk
about how I&amp;rsquo;m going to tackle the next step of this Hugo migration.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;I probably should&amp;rsquo;ve written this while I was doing the install. Oh well, maybe
next time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I managed to get Ubuntu installed on an external hard drive today. The problem
started with me trying to figure out if I could resize the dual boot set up I
have on my Macbook. Reading through my options, I decided it was too hard and I
had other things to do- like work on my Hugo migration from yesterday.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

&lt;p&gt;It&amp;rsquo;s a new month, and so I have some new goals. One of them is to try and use my
website more- and by that I mean blog more. I like the idea of documenting bits
of every day so that in the future I can come back, look at these posts and
piece together how much I&amp;rsquo;ve changed and whatnot.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

post&lt;/a&gt;
I read by Sarah Drasner, I thought it would be a really good idea to list my
&amp;ldquo;studio commandments&amp;rdquo;. Just like Sarah, I can see how these would change over
time. So while this is not what I would&amp;rsquo;ve asked of myself in college, I think
these rules fit my work style these days.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Do you like &lt;code&gt;bash&lt;/code&gt; scripts? Personally, I don&amp;rsquo;t.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So when I need to write bash scripts, I figure out the commands I need, then
glue them together with Python.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It&amp;rsquo;s been a while since I&amp;rsquo;ve needed to do this and while I neglected it before,
the &lt;code&gt;subprocess&lt;/code&gt; module is the best way to run these commands.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;I woke up today and thought, &amp;ldquo;I should put some work into the Technical

put in about an hour of work or so and go from there.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

&lt;p&gt;I woke up this morning not knowing what I want to talk about today. The other
days this week, I had a plan of attack for things I wanted to address.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Reading some articles about blogging though, it seems that some people advoate
for not posting something every day. I hear the appeals to health and
well-being; I get that it can be stressful to try and come up with something to
say every day.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;I have no idea if the title of this post is true. I don&amp;rsquo;t actually want to make
that claim.&lt;/p&gt;

exactly like how I did with JavaScript yesterday.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;ve been reading &amp;ldquo;Eloquent JavaScript&amp;rdquo; by Marijn Haverbeke lately and today I
rediscovered the idea of a higher-order function. I first encountered these in
the freeCodeCamp curriculum, most likely, but I only glanced over them at the
time.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Scratching my head thinking about what I want to write about today, I started
skimming other blogs to get a sense of content and blogging frequency. Daily
blogging might be too much to be sustainable over time, but my rationale is I
learn something almost every day, so that&amp;rsquo;s what I&amp;rsquo;ll write about.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;I just wanted to summerize and reflect on some notes from Day 5, 10, and 11 of
my &lt;code&gt;#100DaysOfCode&lt;/code&gt; challenge on Twitter.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So far, React has been fairly easy to pick up. It started with introducing this
idea of a &lt;code&gt;JSX Element&lt;/code&gt;, which is a mix of HTML and JavaScript that wouldn&amp;rsquo;t
work as pure HTML or pure JavaScript. There are these ideas of nesting the JSX
elements and &lt;code&gt;state&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

&lt;p&gt;It&amp;rsquo;s pretty common to see craftpeople creating tools for themselves for a
variety of reasons. Maybe it&amp;rsquo;s because the exact tool they need doesn&amp;rsquo;t exist;
perhaps a slight modification to a tool would help fit their style more.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>Opening a kiln never gets old. Especially a wood kiln when you never know what will happen to your pieces. Exhibit A is the figure on the far right of the picture. It was standing just fine going into the kiln, but for what is likely a combination of a lot of different reasons, a leg fell off. It&amp;rsquo;s nothing a little super glue can&amp;rsquo;t fix, so there are no negative feelings there.</description>
