  <p>After analyzing my process for writing blog posts, I&rsquo;ve realized some things.</p>

<p>First, I can&rsquo;t write and publish on the same day. I like to write about problems
I&rsquo;ve faced or solutions I&rsquo;ve come up with. Yet solving those problems take up a
lot of the day. If I let it, it can consume the entire day, easily. That&rsquo;s bad
for this idea of blogging everyday because it adds another thing I have to do
to the day; which increases the odds that it&rsquo;s not happening.</p>

<p>Second, I&rsquo;m lacking in the more long form blog post that I want to put out on
like Medium or dev.to. Sure I could just port my daily stuff, but it wouldn&rsquo;t
feel right because these are so casual.</p>

<p>To address these issues, I&rsquo;ve been trying to come up with a system - a blog
post lifecycle, if you will. It&rsquo;s what more professional people do, and while I
don&rsquo;t know their exact system, I can tweak whatever I come up with until I am
satisfied with it.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;ve been planning out how to steal more time for myself throughout the day to
actually write more. This means I should have more time to dedicate to this
&ldquo;lifecycle&rdquo;.</p>

<p>Ideally, I have a 3 day cycle for daily posts:
* Day 1 is for the rough, paper draft
* Day 2 is for an electronic, edited version
* Day 3 is publishing</p>

<p>I&rsquo;ve been planning out a way to automate most of this too, because it would
lower the &ldquo;activation energy&rdquo; needed to keep all of this running.</p>

<p>On top of that, throughout the week, I would also be working on a longer post.
Ideally, these posts get a 6 day cycle:
* 5 days to write the post
* The last day is publishing</p>

<p>This means that I can have daily posts Monday through Friday, a long form post
come out on Saturday, and Sunday be free to plan and do other things.</p>

<hr />

<p>I want to mention that all of this was really triggered by <a href="https://dev.to/vickylai/how-to-set-up-a-short-feedback-loop-as-a-solo-coder-4gbc">this
post</a>
that I read on dev.to.</p>

<p>The idea of shorter feedback loops is not new to me. It&rsquo;s
the same as taking a big goal and breaking it down into a bunch of smaller
goals. The small goals give you the feedback that you are doing something right
much sooner than waiting to see if you accomplish the big goal.</p>

<p>Just to beat the dead horse one more time: small feedback loops are essentially
what all of the different belt colors in martial arts is for. Instead of asking
yourself, &ldquo;Am I a black belt yet?&rdquo;, you can check how far along this
pre-established path you are and trust that you will get there eventually.</p>

<p>Anyway, I was so focused on figuring out what to write about next, I didn&rsquo;t stop
to realize I need to change the process of how I&rsquo;m writing in the first place.</p>

<p>So with a bit of research, a few days of planning, and remembering that I need
to focus on doing this &ldquo;good enough for now&rdquo; instead of &ldquo;perfect&rdquo;, a plan was
born.</p>

<p>Here&rsquo;s to more consistent writing!</p>
