  <h1>Python Web Scraping</h1>
  <time datetime=2018-03-01T10:11:12-0500 class="post-date">Thu, Mar 1, 2018</time>
  <p>Today was my first time in a long time trying to extract a bunch of information
from a website. I was trying to get a file from a set of webpages, so my first
thought was,</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why don&rsquo;t I just figure out the pattern to the URL of the files?&rdquo;. I think it
was a relatively small set of pages to scour, there were only 50 web pages to
look at. So I just started with a sample of them to try and tease out a URL
pattern.</p>

<p>Thinking back to my experience with Revature, I wondered if there was a way to
make Python send HTTP requests for me because that would make things easier on
my part. This thought came after my attempt to find a pattern to the download
links though.</p>

<p>So looking at the URLs, there was a clear template to identifying the files.
Except it is a template that makes my job harder. For each file I wanted to
grab, there were 3 strings attached to it that uniquely identifies it. The
download URLs were simply a mix of these unique strings with some common
strings. This is when I had the thought about making Python make HTTP requests
for me because now I had to build a list of all of the unique strings to build a
URL to run wget with.</p>

<p>Running short on time (I was only trying to do some light pseudocoding today), I
thought let&rsquo;s just brute force this and clean it up later. So I did what I hope
to automate in the coming days: I went to the homepage to use the search bar; I
typed in the unique identifier for the page I want to get to; I searched and let
the page take me to the page containing the download link I want; I copied the
download link and extracted the three unique identifiers; and that was it! I
have a tiny little script to build the URLs for me, request the links I want,
and write them to a target destination on my computer.</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s not the most automated version, but at least I have started and can improve
from here.</p>
