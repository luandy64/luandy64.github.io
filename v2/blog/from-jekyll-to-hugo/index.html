  <h2 id="some-background">Some Background</h2>

<p>It&rsquo;s a new month, and so I have some new goals. One of them is to try and use my
website more- and by that I mean blog more. I like the idea of documenting bits
of every day so that in the future I can come back, look at these posts and
piece together how much I&rsquo;ve changed and whatnot.</p>

<p>So to kick off trying to blog more, I decided to try and fix some of the pain
points I was having with my site now. I&rsquo;ve been doing a bit of research into
static site generators, and decided that maybe using Hugo would be fun. A
long-ish term goal of mine is to dive into Golang a bit, so maybe this can be a
good way to dip my toes in the water.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m planning on doing a more thorough write up of my thoughts on this in the
future, so let&rsquo;s move on to what I did today.</p>

<h2 id="setting-up-hugo">Setting up Hugo</h2>

<p>So on my Mac, it&rsquo;s quick and easy to install Hugo. I just ran <code>brew install hugo</code>.</p>

<p>For my theme, I looked through all of my options on <a href="https://themes.gohugo.io">Hugo
Themes</a> and decided to go with the <code>Hyde</code> theme. I&rsquo;m a
big fan of the two colomn design, where one column serves as a header. I&rsquo;d like
to write my own theme one day because I am also a huge fan of card-based
elements and I haven&rsquo;t seen a theme that does it yet.</p>

<p>After setting up the theme, there was nothing left to do but to layout how I
wanted the sitemap to work. I quickly figured out how to add links to the
sidebar using the method the theme writer(s) intended. The hardest part of what
I did today was to get the individual pages to be structured the way I wanted
them to be. Using Jekyll, it was easy because you put it in the front matter or
just straight up work an <code>index.html</code> file. I dug through the Hugo Docs and
found that Hugo really leans on the structure of the directory your site is
sitting in. So I made all of the appropriate directories in the <code>/layouts</code>
folder, peeked at the <code>Hyde</code> theme folder to get the correct file names, and
made the appropriate <code>list.html</code> and <code>single.html</code> files.</p>

<h2 id="moving-forward">Moving forward</h2>

<p>Next steps are probably to get the CSS set up how I want it. Then I&rsquo;ll work on
porting over old blog posts and fleshing out the <code>About Me</code> section. I haven&rsquo;t
tried to set this up on Github yet, but I&rsquo;ve seen instructions for it, and it&rsquo;s
not too scary looking.</p>
