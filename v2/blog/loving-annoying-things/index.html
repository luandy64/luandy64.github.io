  <h1>Loving Annoying Things</h1>
  <time datetime=2018-10-01T23:05:42-0400 class="post-date">Mon, Oct 1, 2018</time>
  <p>I&rsquo;ve been absorbing quite a bit of content from Gary Vaynerchuk lately. I really
like his idea of not making excuses and getting to work and eating dirt and
loving the process. I mean, it&rsquo;s hard to argue against those things and risk
being associated with negative things; despite that, I personally don&rsquo;t deny
they are good ideas. How much weight you give them is up to you.</p>

<p>To relate eating dirt and loving the process to my title for this post: learning
Clojure has been an annoying process, but a very interesting one.</p>

<p>In the last two weeks, I&rsquo;ve got through 4 or 5 chapters of <code>Clojure for the
Brave and True</code> by Daniel Higginbotham, <a href="https://www.braveclojure.com/clojure-for-the-brave-and-true/">the full book
here.</a> The book
really started to click for me once I hit the fifth chapter on functional
programming.</p>

<p>I know that&rsquo;s when it clicked because while I was reading, I was also trying to
practice coding problems on <a href="https://www.codewars.com/">CodeWars</a>. I was very
lost for the first week and a half- I just couldn&rsquo;t figure out how to get around
the immutability of the data structures in Clojure. Also, the whole &ldquo;operating
on lists/sequences&rdquo; to make other sequences was a simple enough idea to wrap my
head around. However, using that to solve a problem was a real head scratcher.</p>

<p>Anyway, the moral of the story is that the Clojure standard library is vast and
extensive. And while I have the right idea of how to approach some of these more
basic problems I am encountering, I should go look for the function that does it
already, instead of implementing it myself.</p>

<p>Here&rsquo;s the piece of code in question:</p>

<pre><code class="language-clojure">
;; Given `num` = 10x+y, 
;; return some `val` = x - 2y

;; My version 
;; - Complained if num was too big
(defn decomp [num]
    (- (/ num 10) (* 2 (mod num 10)))
    
;; The Good Version
(defn decomp [num]
    (- (quot num 10) (* 2 (mod num 10))))
</code></pre>
