<p>After analyzing my process for writing blog posts, I’ve realized some things.</p>

<!--more-->

<p>First, I can’t write and publish on the same day. I like to write about problems
I’ve faced or solutions I’ve come up with. Yet solving those problems take up a 
lot of the day. If I let it, it can consume the entire day, easily. That’s bad 
for this idea of blogging everyday because it adds another thing I have to do 
to the day; which increases the odds that it’s not happening.</p>

<p>Second, I’m lacking in the more long form blog post that I want to put out on
like Medium or dev.to. Sure I could just port my daily stuff, but it wouldn’t
feel right because these are so casual.</p>

<p>To address these issues, I’ve been trying to come up with a system - a blog 
post lifecycle, if you will. It’s what more professional people do, and while I 
don’t know their exact system, I can tweak whatever I come up with until I am 
satisfied with it.</p>

<p>I’ve been planning out how to steal more time for myself throughout the day to
actually write more. This means I should have more time to dedicate to this
“lifecycle”.</p>

<p>Ideally, I have a 3 day cycle for daily posts:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Day 1 is for the rough, paper draft</li>
  <li>Day 2 is for an electronic, edited version</li>
  <li>Day 3 is publishing</li>
</ul>

<p>I’ve been planning out a way to automate most of this too, because it would
lower the “activation energy” needed to keep all of this running.</p>

<p>On top of that, throughout the week, I would also be working on a longer post. 
Ideally, these posts get a 6 day cycle:</p>
<ul>
  <li>5 days to write the post</li>
  <li>The last day is publishing</li>
</ul>

<p>This means that I can have daily posts Monday through Friday, a long form post
come out on Saturday, and Sunday be free to plan and do other things.</p>

<p>I want to mention that all of this was really triggered by <a href="https://dev.to/vickylai/how-to-set-up-a-short-feedback-loop-as-a-solo-coder-4gbc">this
post</a>
that I read on dev.to.</p>

<p>The idea of shorter feedback loops is not new to me. It’s
the same as taking a big goal and breaking it down into a bunch of smaller
goals. The small goals give you the feedback that you are doing something right
much sooner than waiting to see if you accomplish the big goal.</p>

<p>Just to beat the dead horse one more time: small feedback loops are essentially
what all of the different belt colors in martial arts is for. Instead of asking
yourself, “Am I a black belt yet?”, you can check how far along this
pre-established path you are and trust that you will get there eventually.</p>

<p>Anyway, I was so focused on figuring out what to write about next, I didn’t stop
to realize I need to change the process of how I’m writing in the first place.</p>

<p>So with a bit of research, a few days of planning, and remembering that I need
to focus on doing this “good enough for now” instead of “perfect”, a plan was
born.</p>

<p>Here’s to more consistent writing!</p>
