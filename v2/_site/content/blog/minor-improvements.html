<p>Inspired by some posts I read on Medium, I found new reasons to build the habit
of keeping a journal. This whole idea deserves it’s own post one day, but for
now I was just bringing it up because my journal is oriented by months.</p>

<p>For the month of September, I set out to blog more. More specifically, I devised
a schedule for myself and tried to stick to it.</p>

<p>This morning, seeing that September is half over, I decided to check in on
myself and see how I am doing.</p>

<p>To my surprise, I’ve written a lot less than I thought I have. I’ve put out 7
posts in the last 15 days. While it’s not bad, I think the dangerous thing is
that I didn’t notice it sooner.</p>

<p>So I’m going to work towards being a bit more self-aware with regards to my
writing this week. Starting with this post, can I hit 7 out of 7 for this
upcoming week?</p>

<p>Oh and I’m going to repost my blog on Medium on a delay. I’ll figure out the
plan tomorrow though.</p>

<p>In other news, I made a few tweaks to the site today.</p>

<p>Design is not one of my strong points, but after reading a post earlier about
typography, I decided to make one small change immediately: I changed the main
font of the site.</p>

<p>I don’t know why, I don’t even know if I picked a good one. But I did it. So
here’s to one small step in learning about design choices.</p>
