<p>After a few hours of work, I was able to get the bare minimum of this site
rewritten for <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">hugo</code>. I’ll work on finalizing the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">/home</code> and <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">/about</code> pages
slowly but surely; for now though, I am more than satisfied with just having the
blog up and running.</p>

<p>While I was working on the migration, I read up on some things I would like to
incorporate some day:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>Hugo has support for Emacs users to write the pages in Org mode. That’s
exciting to even just try out for an article or two; especially considering
that at some point I was trying to write a Python script to change an org file
to markdown for Jekyll.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>A goal I’ve had in the start is to write the site from scractch, and that goal
has been reinvigorated with this migration.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>Some hiccups I encountered along the way:</p>

<ul>
  <li>I glossed over the one line in the Hugo Documentation that was like “User
pages have to have the files for the site on the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">master</code> branch”. I read that
after I learned about setting up multiple working trees and put all of my
files in a <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">gh-pages</code> branch.
    <ul>
      <li>No worries, I just swapped the two branches essentially. So <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">master</code> holds
the Hugo generated website files, and my <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">dev</code> branch holds the files that
generate the files that need to sit in <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">master</code>.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>There was a path issue in linking the CSS files. In the config you can set the
<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">baseURL</code> of the site, and in the theme I am using, the author references that
variable directly, like so: <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">{Site.baseURL}css/nameOfStylesheet.css</code>. You get
the point. Naturally, you would think to set the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">baseURL=
/</code>. That way when it is referenced later, I get a
properly formed url to the CSS file.
    <ul>
      <li>Right now, the ‘baseURL’ lacks a trailing <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">/</code>, and I edited the theme to
include the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">/</code> between <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">{Site.baseURL}</code> and the rest of the path to the
stylesheet. I plan to look into what is considered the better practice,
but for now, it works as is.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>
