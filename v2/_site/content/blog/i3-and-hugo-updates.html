<h2 id="hugo-updates">Hugo Updates</h2>
<p>I spent a nice chunk of today figuring out what I wanted to do as far as styling goes. The theme I picked, <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Hyde</code>, was did a 
majority of the work already.</p>

<!--more-->

<p>I just had to hook into the snippet of HTML that defines the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">&lt;head&gt;</code> and add my own stylesheet. From there, the only change I 
wanted to make was making everything a card. But then that led to some padding issues, so I patched that really quickly.</p>

<p>Overall, I’m really satisfied with the design. Now I just have to move over all of the pages and blog posts. I learned that I 
was pretty inconsistent with the front matter I included in the blog posts. I’ll just have to go back and clean things up. I 
will probably automate the adding and removing of the keys, but will have to add the values afterwards.</p>

<h2 id="i3-updates">i3 Updates</h2>
<p>I’ve been gluing together bits and pieces of various configurations to get i3 to work. Some parts were quick:</p>
<ul>
  <li>The background was straight forward</li>
  <li>Setting up my workspaces was easy
    <ul>
      <li>Though, I haven’t bound certain applications to my named workspaces yet</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Installing Font Awesome was much easier than Source Code Pro. I might have to find an alternative here. It’s mainly for <br />
Spacemacs, but it seems to function fine without it.</li>
  <li>I’ve themed i3 to match the Nord Theme for Spacemacs</li>
</ul>

<p>The only- what I would call- dire issue is I can’t get the brightness control to work. So as I sit here and type this, there’s this blindingly bright screen that I’m forced to look at and can do nothing about.</p>

<h2 id="next-steps">Next Steps</h2>
<p>I put some config stuff from my Mac onto Github, but I later learned, I didn’t put some of the files I needed. I’m hoping to 
finish up with all of this i3 stuff soon and I can throw all of those files up too. I think a really nice guide is due too 
because I wouldn’t want someone else to try and do the same thing here and be as lost as I was.</p>
