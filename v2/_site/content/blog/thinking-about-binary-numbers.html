<p>I was working with Lauren to teach her how to convert between binary and decimal
numbers. I think it’s super interesting to get to visit these ideas with her and
see how “fresh eyes” see them for the first time.</p>

<p>Another super interesting thing that I don’t think I’ve thought about before is
multiplying binary numbers. She and I touched very briefly on what addition
looks like.</p>

<p>In the moment though, I could not wrap my head around what subtraction looks
like. Multiplication I tried to think about since it’s “close” to what addition
is, I figured I could reason through it.</p>

<p>Keeping a simple example in mind, I tried to multiply <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">11</code> by <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">11</code>- these being
<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">3</code> in decimal. Knowing the answer had to look like <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">1001</code>, I stumbled trying
come up with a reason that “normal multiplication” works.</p>

<p>This may or may not look confusing:</p>
<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>(11) * (11) = (11) * (10) + (11) * (1) = (110) + (11) = 1001  
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>There was a little voice in the back of my head that said I have seen this
before, but where?</p>

<p>It hit me. Abstract Algebra, of course.</p>

<p>Binary numbers are just strings of zeros and ones, which is exactly what the
group  of integers mod 2 is. Of course I’m using addition mod 2 as the group
operation here, but I took a second to think about if I could easily throw
multiplication into this.</p>

<p>Now, Abstract Algebra was like 3 months ago, so I don’t remember all of the
details of what needs to be satisfied to form a ring. I am pretty convinced this
can be one of those “The proof is left to the readers as an exercise” moments.</p>
<ul>
  <li>For completions sake, I think the easiest way to convince yourself of this is
that since we have a mapping from binary numbers to the natural numbers, and
multiplication is closed with regards to the naturals, then that mapping is an
isomorphism and we have closure of multiplication for binary numbers. But
again, it’s been a while since I touched this material and I am purely going
off of my gut here.</li>
</ul>

<p>So that’s how I convinced myself that I can multiply binary numbers. I carry out
the “normal multiplication algorithm”, multiply mod 2, and remember to carry the
1 when necessary.</p>

<p>I need to start a series of posts or just a really long post where I note a
handful of times where you can lift the hood on things and find some math. It’s
a pretty neat moment when it happens, if you appreciate that sort of thing.</p>
