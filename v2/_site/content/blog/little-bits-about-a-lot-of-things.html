<h2 id="little-bit-one-not-knowing-what-to-write-about">Little Bit One: Not knowing what to write about</h2>
<p>I woke up this morning not knowing what I want to talk about today. The other
days this week, I had a plan of attack for things I wanted to address.</p>

<p>Reading some articles about blogging though, it seems that some people advoate
for not posting something every day. I hear the appeals to health and
well-being; I get that it can be stressful to try and come up with something to
say every day.</p>

<!--more-->

<p>I’m in a different camp though. Being someone who likes to juggle a lot of
projects at once, there’s always an issue I could be working on. Maybe not even
an issue. During the “complete-this-project” phase, it’s always nice to know
what the next step is; thus, having an unfinished project means there’s always a
“next thing” to tackle.</p>

<p>Since I’m not a super genius, working on a project means confronting a problem
and having to do a bit of digging to try and overcome it.</p>

<p>That’s what I’d like my blog posts to be about.</p>

<h2 id="little-bit-two-spacemacs-update">Little Bit Two: Spacemacs Update</h2>
<p>I took a step back from learning Spacemacs a while ago. It was eating up a lot
of time because I would have a question and google some things and get lost in
how great some other feature is. Time was not something I had a lot of because I
really wanted to finish  some websites and get the freeCodeCamp Responsive Web
Design certificate.</p>

<p>I still don’t have the certificate; I am closer than I was when I stopped using
Spacemacs. I happened to open it up the other day and taking some notes with it
just felt great.</p>

<p>I found some new features that I can’t see myself living without now:</p>
<ul>
  <li><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">SPC t r</code> toggles “relative line numbers” to appear. Instead of normal line
numbers, I see how far away a line is from the line I am editing on. This is
great to use with Vim navigation because I just type in the number of lines I
want to move, the direction I want to go, and I go!</li>
  <li>
    <p><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">SPC t -</code> followed by <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">H</code> or <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">L</code> has changed the way I scroll through a
document. The first command forces my cursor to sit on the equator of the
screen. <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">H</code> says to move the cursor to the line at the top of my screen. So
basically the whole screen scrolls until the top line is my equator line! <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">L</code>
is the same thing, but for the bottom line.</p>

    <p>The issue isn’t that other editors can’t do these things. It’s 2018, I’m sure
someone somewhere has written the package that makes X editor do the same
thing. It’s just that I’ll use Spacemacs for like an hour, get used to having
the features, go use something else, realize I lack those features, and that’s
where the problem is: why take the time to install/configure the features,
when I can just open Spacemacs and have it immdiately.</p>

    <p>I like to refer to this <a href="https://xkcd.com/1205/">xkcd comic</a> when dealing with
things like this.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>I ended up having a lot to say here, so I’m moving it to a new post. This one
turned out much longer than I thought it would.</p>
