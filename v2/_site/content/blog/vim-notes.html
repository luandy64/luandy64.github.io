<h2 id="honing-your-tools">Honing your tools</h2>

<p>It’s pretty common to see craftpeople creating tools for themselves for a
variety of reasons. Maybe it’s because the exact tool they need doesn’t exist;
perhaps a slight modification to a tool would help fit their style more.</p>

<!--more-->

<p>Whatever the case, I want to assert that this happens often. This is why I like
to take time to learn about text editors from the ’70s. I take no stance on the
whole Emacs v. Vim thing; it’s a pretty silly thing to argue about. Plus, my
setup is running <a href="http://spacemacs.org/">Spacemacs</a>, a version of Emacs focused
on Vim keybindings, so I am not even sure how to categorize that one.</p>

<p>I’m not particularly new to the app actually. I’ve been slowly configuring it to
my liking as I learn about new features. As someone who spends a lot of time
editing text files, I don’t mind honing my knowledge of this tool.</p>

<p>So on that note, I watched <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlR5gYd6um0">Mastering the Vim
Language</a> by ThoughtBot on YouTube
and took some notes.</p>

<p>If you think of Vim as a language, then the commands can be thought of as a
“verb” + “noun” couple. It also helps that the keybindings are more or less
abbrieviations of the action or phrase they represent.</p>
