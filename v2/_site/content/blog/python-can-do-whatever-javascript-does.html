<p>I have no idea if the title of this post is true. I don’t actually want to make
that claim.</p>

<p>I did discover one way of defining higher order functions in Python though,
exactly like how I did with JavaScript yesterday.</p>

<!--more-->

<p>I’ll use the same example functions as yesterday, so if you get lost, go read
that post first. I’ll wait right here.</p>

<p>Here’s the example in Python, I figure it’s easiest to look over the whole
piece of code first:</p>
<pre><code class="language-python3">#!/usr/bin/env python3

def plusNum(num):
  return lambda x: x + num
  
plusOne = plusNum(1)
plusTwo = plusNum(2)

print(plusOne(2) == 3)
print(plusTwo(2) == 4)
</code></pre>

<p>I’m not very familiar with Lambda functions, this was just the first thing I
tried. If this had failed, I read in the Python Documentation that there is 
a Standard library module called <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">functools</code>. Read about it 
<a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/functools.html">here</a>.</p>

<p>I will look into all of this more and figure out how Python does it. I wonder
what the most Pythonic way of doing it is too.</p>
