<p>I just came across the so called “Three Glass Problem” and thought I would try 
and solve it. It turns out to be fairly trivial with a bit of abstract algebra!
<!--more--></p>

<p>Obviously there are spoilers ahead if you have never heard of this problem. So
turn away now if you care for the challenge!</p>

<p>The problem goes as follows: Given 3 cups, one that holds 8 units of liquid,
one that holds 5 units of liquid, and one that holds 3 units of liquid, create
two servings 4 units in volume.</p>

<p>Here is your final warning if you want to work this out for yourself. Below is 
my solution.</p>

<p>For the sake of clarity, I’m going to say the goal is to measure out 2 drinks
of 4 fluid ounces each. Knowing that we have to create two drinks, I assumed
each drink had to be created with the 3 ounce cup and one of the other cups.
Since we can fill cups and combine them and dump them when full, I thought of
cyclic groups with addition mod \(n\) as a perfect model for this problem.
Specifically, \(\mathbb{Z}_8\) and \(\mathbb{Z}_5\) will be used here.</p>

<p>As a reminder the cyclic group \(\mathbb{Z}_n\) is the group under addition mod
\(n\), where the group elements are \(0,1,2, \ldots, n\). Another term we need
is the group “generated” by \(a\), where \(a\) is in \(\mathbb{Z}_n\). So the
group generated by \(a\) looks like: \(\{a, 2a, 3a, \ldots, 0\}\).</p>

<p>The group generated by \(3\) in \(\mathbb{Z}_8\) is 
\(\{3, 6, 1, 4, 7, 2, 5, 0\}\).</p>

<p>Similarly, the group generated by \(3\) in \(\mathbb{Z}_5\) is 
\(\{3, 1, 4, 2, 0\}\).</p>

<p>So following these “instructions” gives you this:</p>

<p>First, fill the 3 and pour it into the 8 twice, giving you 6 in the 8. Fill 
the 3 again, top off the 8, giving you 1 in the 3. Dump the 8 and move the 1
from the 3 to the 8. Fill the 3 one last time, and transfer to the 8. Boom, 
first drink done.</p>

<p>Now take fill the 3 and pour it into the 5. Fill the 3 and top off the 5, 
giving you 1 in the 3 and dump the 5. Transfer the 1 to the 5, and add one 
last 3. This gives you the second 4 ounce drink. QED.</p>
