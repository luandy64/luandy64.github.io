<p>The title says it all!</p>

<p>I finally got this site up and running. I could not have done it without a lot 
of googling and stumbling upon Jekyll.</p>

<p>I hope to add more to this site as time
moves on. For the rest of this break, I hope to get a good amount of work in.
However, once the semester starts up again, I know things will get busy and 
work here will slow down.</p>

<p>Thanks for reading this post! Comments, questions, and feedback are always
welcome.</p>
