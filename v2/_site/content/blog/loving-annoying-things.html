<p>I’ve been absorbing quite a bit of content from Gary Vaynerchuk lately. I really
like his idea of not making excuses and getting to work and eating dirt and
loving the process. I mean, it’s hard to argue against those things and risk
being associated with negative things; despite that, I personally don’t deny
they are good ideas. How much weight you give them is up to you.</p>

<p>To relate eating dirt and loving the process to my title for this post: learning
Clojure has been an annoying process, but a very interesting one.</p>

<p>In the last two weeks, I’ve got through 4 or 5 chapters of <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Clojure for the
Brave and True</code> by Daniel Higginbotham, <a href="https://www.braveclojure.com/clojure-for-the-brave-and-true/">the full book
here.</a> The book
really started to click for me once I hit the fifth chapter on functional
programming.</p>

<p>I know that’s when it clicked because while I was reading, I was also trying to
practice coding problems on <a href="https://www.codewars.com/">CodeWars</a>. I was very
lost for the first week and a half- I just couldn’t figure out how to get around
the immutability of the data structures in Clojure. Also, the whole “operating
on lists/sequences” to make other sequences was a simple enough idea to wrap my
head around. However, using that to solve a problem was a real head scratcher.</p>

<p>Anyway, the moral of the story is that the Clojure standard library is vast and
extensive. And while I have the right idea of how to approach some of these more
basic problems I am encountering, I should go look for the function that does it
already, instead of implementing it myself.</p>

<p>Here’s the piece of code in question:</p>
<div class="language-clojure highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="w">
