<p>Opening a kiln never gets old. Especially a wood kiln when you never know what
will happen to your pieces. Exhibit A is the figure on the far right of the
picture. It was standing just fine going into the kiln, but for what is likely
a combination of a lot of different reasons, a leg fell off. It’s nothing a
little super glue can’t fix, so there are no negative feelings there.</p>

<p>One of the more interesting things I’ll note, since I haven’t really had time
to sit down and look at these pieces in detail, the two cups in the front row
of the left side are basically identical cups. However, placement in the kiln
though exposed them to different conditions, resulting in different finishes.
It’s a blessing or a curse depending on what you are going for, but it’s
something you always have to consider when making pieces for a wood kiln.</p>

<p>Now I just need to find a home for each piece and move on to making the next
batch!</p>
