It doesn&amp;rsquo;t cover my mobile reading experience, but maybe I don&amp;rsquo;t care for now.

I think the most engaging way to do that is to use it to compile QMK into some rust-ified executible and run my daily driver keyboard off of it.
Obviously, I shouldn&amp;rsquo;t brick my main keyboard to start. But thankfully, the previous keyboard I used daily is also using the same microprocessor. So I already have a playground or two, I just need to tweak emacs to get to work.</description></item></channel></rss>
