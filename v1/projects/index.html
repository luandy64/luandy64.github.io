<h2> Static Code Analyzer </h2>
<p>
    <em>Language: C++</em>
</p>
<p>
    Quantifying good code is not an easy task. There are too many things to
    measure and in the end you ask yourself, "Does this capture it? Does this
    tell someone their code is good?". Source code is meant to be read by
    humans, thus I narrowed my question of "good code" down to a question of
    human readability.

    This program parses all source code files in a directory and all of its
    sub-directories. In the process of parsing, it looks at:
</p>
<ul>
    <li>The ratio of total lines of whitespace to total lines of code</li>
    <li>The ratio of total whitespace characters to total number of characters</li>
    <li>The ratio of comments to total lines of code</li>
    <li>The average length of variable and function names</li>
    <li>The number of temp variables with names of length 1 or 2</li>
</ul>
<p>
    The raw data is then passed into some metric functions to return a score,
    ranging from 1 to 3 to represent "Good", "Needs Work", and "Bad". The scores
    are then summed to give the final score, with a lower final score being
    better than a higher one. A feature of this program is to also print some
    more verbose test results when the program is called with the appropriate
    flag.

    Any future work put into this would likely be towards adding a "cyclomatic
    complexity" metric, expanding readability into comprehensibility.

<h2>Text Blast</h2>
<p><em>Language: Python, Applescript</em></p>
<p>
    This project was born out of necessity. In my work with CollegeBound, it was
    mentioned in an officer meeting that we needed to message the kids every
    week with announcements and reminders. There were 200 something kids to text
    and only like 5 or 6 officers to do the texting. Naturally, I said we are
    not doing this for 16 weeks; so keeping in mind xkcd's 
    <a href="https://xkcd.com/1205/">comic</a>
    , I set out to mimic a service like Remind. 
</p>
<p>
    The basics of the program is to take a file containing the numbers I needed
    to text, type in the message I want to send, and let it send it to each
    phone number on the list. The program works because of macOS's ability to
    send and receive messages if there is an associated iPhone. Once the program
    runs, it is indistinguishable from me physically sending each message
    myself.

<div id="monteCarlo">
<h2>Monte Carlo Integration</h2>
<p><em> Language: C++</em></p>
<p>
    Unlike the integration problems found in a typical calculus book, integrals
    encountered in research or applications can get ugly. The Monte Carlo
    integration is special, in that, it can handle problems where we are
    working in high dimensions (like past 3 for example) or where the domain
    of integration is irregular.
</p>
<p> 
    To understand the process, imagine a circle with a radius of 1. If you
    compute the area of this circle, you get &pi;.
</p>
<p> 
    There's roughly three parts to the MC Integration: draw a box around the
    domain of integration, "throw darts" at the box, and count the number of
    darts in the domain versus the total number of darts.
</p>
<p> 
    So in the circle with an area of &pi; example: draw a box around the circle,
    "throw darts at the box", and keep count. The ratio of darts that land in
    the circle, over the total number of darts you throw will approach the area
    of the circle if you use more and more darts.
</p>
<p> 
    I left out a whole lot of details here, but I hope the analogy was clear.
    The darts would be implemented by a random number generator; the circle is
    the domain of integration we care about; the ratio of darts-in over
    total-darts is the answer we care about.

<h2>Parallelized Monte Carlo Integration</h2>
<p><em>Language: C++</em></p>
<p>
    One of the coolest topics I got to learn about in school was how to use
    various libraries to parallelize some code. When writing programs in
    serial, it's hard enough to capture the logic, make the code readable,
    and follow good development principles; however, in writing parallel code,
    there is the extra problem of breaking up the work, or find race conditions,
    or deciding if things should run asychronously, and much more. I think the
    added complexity makes things so much more interesting though and in the end
    it can have massive benefits.
</p>
<p>
    I used OpenMP and MPI to learn two different ways to parallelize this
    little tool of mine. The MPI version was much more impressive because I
    could run it on many more machines- if you're counting machines versus
    threads in OpenMP.

<h2>Neuron Modeling</h2>
<p><em>Language: MATLAB</em></p>
<p>
    Neurons are a very interesting type of cell because they use electricity to
    operate. One challenge that comes with studying these cells is collecting
    data to study. Thus, if we can accurately model these cells and how they
    interact with one another, we can run large scale simulations on super
    computers. It turns out that the retina is a well understood part of the
    brain, so much so that we can accurately recreate models of single cells
    accurately. So modeling it should give insight complex systems of neurons.
</p>
<p>
    The issue I worked at while conducting this research with a professor was
    answering how do these cells operate in a noisy environment? A single cell
    can receive many signals from neighboring cells; it has to then account for
    all of these and decide whether or not to propagate the signal. For the set
    of data we were working with, it seemed to fit an exponential model pretty
    well. We were able to clarify for what values we were likely to see a voltage
    spike to occur- which corresponds to a signal being propagated.

<h2>Digital Publishing</h2>
<p><em>Languages: Java, HTML, CSS, PostgreSQL</em></p>
<p>
    This internship was my first exposure to writing an application and hosting
    it on a server. It's also where I learned about databases for the first
    time; which I was intrigued to see how they related to set theory. 
</p>
<p>
    It was also refreshing to tackle a problem like this because I could imagine
    setting up a site like this for a company. The goal of this project was to
    create a site where authors can upload documents like ebooks and set a price
    for customers to buy them at. Since the types of problems I have mostly
    worked on revolved around software as a means to an answer, not really
    software as a service, I really felt like I learned a lot. Of course, diving
    into a new way of programming like this doesn't come without a fair share of
    googling questions along the way. However, if I didn't have prior experience
    with coding, I could see how it could be daunting for someone to attempt a
    project like this.
