* Dev Setup

  On a fresh clone of this repo, you should do the following


  #+begin_src sh
    git checkout dev

    git submodule update

    rm -rf ./public

    git worktree add ./public master
  #+end_src

* On Writing

  I've added an archetype for the two types of posts I currently support on this
  site.

  #+begin_src sh
    hugo new handwritten/restarting-my-corner-of-the-internet.md
    Content "/Users/andylu/git/luandy64.github.io/content/handwritten/restarting-my-corner-of-the-internet.md" created
  #+end_src

  #+begin_src sh
    hugo new blog/til-silica-gel.md
    Content "/Users/andylu/git/luandy64.github.io/content/blog/til-silica-gel.md" created
  #+end_src

* Deploying

  So you're writing on the dev branch. Then when you're ready to publish, run

  - =hugo serve= to render only non-draft pages
  - =hugo= on the dev branch
  - =git add .= on the master branch
  - commit and push the master and wait for the site to update
